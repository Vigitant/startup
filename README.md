Quintus is a game that I came up with in high school and have been playing ever since.
The rules are simple: take any five digits and, while keeping them in their order,
try to turn it into a valid equation.
For instance, 84604 could have the solution 8-4+(6*0)=4. Seems simple, right?
Can you find a solution for 65535?
In making Quintus a self contained program, everything I was once using would all be in 
the same place, streamlined for crunching number after number.
Not only that, but having it online would open many more possibilites for social play,
progression tracking, and customization options.
