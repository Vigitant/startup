Quintus is a game that I came up with in high school and have been playing ever since.
The rules are simple: take any five digits and, while keeping them in their order,
try to turn it into a valid equation.
For instance, 84604 could have the solution 8-4+(6*0)=4. Seems simple, right?
Can you find a solution for 65535?
In making Quintus a self contained program, everything I was once using would all be in 
the same place, streamlined for crunching number after number.
Not only that, but having it online would open many more possibilites for social play,
progression tracking, and customization options.

Simon HTML notes:

A lot of the knowledge I've gained in other programming languages
transfers over to web development pretty nicely, like taking things
slowly, implementing features one at a time, and overall making things
simple and straightforward will always be the best course of action.

There are clearly a lot of things implemented into modern HTML that
make programming easier for those just learning to use it, not to
mention the many resources on the internet to help explain things.

When thinking about my final project for the class, I had some concerns
about things like having multiple pages or how images will display,
but after having done this assignment I can see that I was worried about
those things for nothing - little things like that are much simpler than
I previously thought.

Simon CSS notes:

I feel like CSS is kind of a nice mid-way point between html and Javascript
as far as difficulty goes - while not as simple as html, it nevertheless
is still pretty straightforward and, as far as I can tell so far,
doesn't require a lot of knowledge of crazy intricate programming stuff
like other languages do.

I'm somewhat intimidated by all the decisions that come with CSS - 
how do I want my site to look? What are all the different ways
people may be visiting my site, and how should I prepare for each of
those? What if something seems really simple in my mind, but is actually
really tricky to implement? For now, I think I'm just going to keep things
simple.

I'm still new to the world of computer programming, so I'm still
somewhat perplexed at how files of different language types interact
with each other. Thankfully, learning all of this interesting stuff
is one of the things I really enjoy about computer science.

Startup HTML and CSS notes:

Man, people weren't kidding when they said that alignment in CSS is a
patience tester. I was able to get things oriented in a way that looks
good to me now, but I spent a lot of time and I'm still not done. I
suppose it stems from there being so many options for alignment built
into CSS, which ultimately is a good thing, but compared to the relative
simplicity of other basic functions, it's definitely a hurdle.

One of the nice things about working on something that I'm interested in
and came up with on my own is that I can decide what features to roll
out and at what pace. It took a lot of work to get my page having the
basics, but I can now tinker with it to implement other pages and
elements without, hopefully, having to redo what I've already got solid.

Simon Javascript notes:

All programs are different, needing some kinds of code but not others.
There are many things I still really don't understand about Javascript.
Thankfully, I think my startup is relatively simple. Of course, I will
need to know a lot more than what my startup project needs if I am to
make more programs - I can't just cross my fingers and hope that nothing
I don't understand ever comes up. But I'm glad I can build my program
at my own pace, and that having it be personally picked gives me the
motivation to figure out all the different components.

Javascript is the most "code-y" of the three languages that we have
learned about thus far - it has a lot of different options for a lot
of powerful features.
