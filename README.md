Quintus is a game that I came up with in high school and have been playing ever since.
The rules are simple: take any five digits and, while keeping them in their order,
try to turn it into a valid equation.
For instance, 84604 could have the solution 8-4+(6*0)=4. Seems simple, right?
Can you find a solution for 65535?
In making Quintus a self contained program, everything I was once using would all be in 
the same place, streamlined for crunching number after number.
Not only that, but having it online would open many more possibilites for social play,
progression tracking, and customization options.

Simon HTML notes:

A lot of the knowledge I've gained in other programming languages
transfers over to web development pretty nicely, like taking things
slowly, implementing features one at a time, and overall making things
simple and straightforward will always be the best course of action.

There are clearly a lot of things implemented into modern HTML that
make programming easier for those just learning to use it, not to
mention the many resources on the internet to help explain things.

When thinking about my final project for the class, I had some concerns
about things like having multiple pages or how images will display,
but after having done this assignment I can see that I was worried about those things for nothing - little things like that are much simpler than I previously thought.
