I can use VS Code as a workspace to continue working on and
modifying whatever programs I'm working on, and having it be
connected to github allows others to see what I've done and be
able to collaborate.

It's important to make sure that everything stays updated on
both ends of the pipeline.

It's also very important to be putting notes on everything you
do, both for the sake of others as well as yourself.
